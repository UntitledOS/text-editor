splatpad uses Qt 6 and is written fully in python using the PySide6 library. It is designed to be as fast as possible and get out of your way.

Every feature is intentional. A traditional toolbar is not used, as it would mean common actions are hidden away in submenus. Instead, a simple hotbar of every action available is at the top of the window.

A pathbar is included at the bottom which will update automatically but also allow you to manually enter or paste in a path.

Keyboard shortcuts such as Ctrl+S, Ctrl+Shift+S and Ctrl+O are supported to speed up common actions.

splatpad supports opening files with the text mimetype. This means you can set splatpad as your default text editor.
